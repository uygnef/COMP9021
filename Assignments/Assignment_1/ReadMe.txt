This is a list of over 100,000 English words transcribed
orthographically. I obtained it from The Interociter bulletin
board in Dallas (214/258-1832). The original read.me file said
that the list came from Public Brand Software.

The original list contained 146,440 words, but I discovered that
there were thousands of duplicate words. I resorted the list and
removed the duplicates using the Unix utility uniq. The total
number of words is now 109,582. I have repackaged the list into
four files (the original was five):

     File         Bytes    Words   Range
     ---------    ------   -----   -----
     words1.lst   315376   29839   A-D
     words2.lst   242484   23101   E-K
     words3.lst   325716   30439   L-R
     words4.lst   270759   26203   S-Z
                  ----------------
     Total       1154335  109582

This word list includes inflected forms, such as plural nouns and
the -s, -ed and -ing forms of verbs. Thus the number of lexical stems
represented in the list is considerably smaller than the total
number of words.
